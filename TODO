Not planning on doing for now
- All tank spells
- Aug mastery: hard to calculate, and nobody plays around it (it's used on cd for dps). Quite powerful tho
- Chrono ward: same as above
- Light's Protection: hard to play around and not really worth it for 2% DR
- Echoing Blessings on Sac: not worth it for 2% DR (32% instead of 30%)



New patch work
- Armor K Value
- Absorb backup values
- Wowhead PTR links
